# QGIS 2025 - Collecting Field Data with QGIS and Mergin Maps
Home page for the workshop

### Description
This workshop covers everything you need to know to work with Mergin Maps. If you are new to Mergin Maps and QGIS, I will begin with a gentle introduction. This includes all the basic steps of setting up a project in QGIS, configuring survey layers and conducting your first field survey. If you are familiar with Mergin Maps, this workshop will include information on more advanced workflows. For example, advanced project configuration and information on project management and collaboration principles. Unleash the full power of the Mergin Maps platform. The workshop will cover topics such as:

* Introduction -
Learn to install QGIS and create a Mergin Maps account. Then install the Mergin Maps mobile app and the Mergin Maps QGIS plugin.

* Setting up a Project in QGIS - Learn about best practices and configuration options for your first project. Create a survey layer, add basemaps and explore your project in the Mergin Maps mobile app.

* Configure Survey Layers - 
How to configure QGIS field widgets for numerous applications. Use special Mergin Maps variables and the Drag and Drop Designer to create an intuitive and more intelligent field data collection form.

* Conducting a Field Survey - 
Take your project outside on your mobile device and collect your first data. This includes learning about position tracking, navigation options, synchronizing the data back to QGIS and use of the Mergin Maps Processing Algorithms.

* Advanced Project Configuration -
Do you need more customized projects? Learn advanced options for form configuration, advanced photo settings and how to work with non-spatial tables to create cascading forms.

* Project Management and Collaboration - 
Learn to manage a project for any size organization. Discover how to add users, set permissions and manage project versions.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
* Design field data collection projects in QGIS.
* Set up synchronization with Mergin Maps.
* Collect and update spatial data in the field using a mobile device.
* Sync and manage field data centrally using the Mergin platform.


#### Software

We will be using the current long-term release of QGIS (3.40 Bratislava) 

You can download it from the official QGIS website and if using Windows you can use the OSGeo4W installer.

**Note 1**: If you will be using a corporate laptop where permissions can be problematic, consider getting these installations completed with IT before you travel to the conference.

**Note 2**: It is recommended that you also bring a tablet. There is an accompanying step-by-step tutorial. Having a tablet will allow you to read the tutorial on your tablet while working on your laptop.

### Introduction - What is Mergin Maps?
Mergin Maps is a collaborative space allowing you to store and synchronise QGIS projects across multiple mobile and desktop clients. The Mergin Maps QGIS plugin is used to sync your project between your computer, your Mergin Maps Server account and then to your mobile device. The Mergin Maps mobile app is used to collect data with a smart phone or tablet. Collectively, these tools create a very robust and affordable data collection set up. This course focuses on how to set up a QGIS project, work with Mergin Maps to collect field data and sync it back to your computer.
